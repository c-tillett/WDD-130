        <p class="homepage_paragraph">
          FIREBALL is a weekly Fighting Game Tournament Series located in
          Rexburg Idaho. In Rexburg, tournaments and organizations surrounding
          Super Smash Brothers have always been prevelant. Though some have
          tried, many have failed to give traditional Fighting Games a true home
          in Rexburg. Upon the release of Street Fighter 6, however, something
          shook up the smash community. Interest in traditional, or
          2-Demensional Fighting games took flight. Since January of 2023,
          FIREBALL has been a weekly event, allowing those who put in the effort
          to show their dominance in Street Fighter VI, Guilty Gear: Strive,
          Tekken 8, and, more recently, Marvel vs. Capcom 2. All are welcome at
          FIREBALL! If you've never played any of the games that we run, that's
          okay! We'd love to teach you. You haven't played in a long time?
          Welcome back, we'll help de-rust those skills of yours! Don't have a
          controller? We have spares! I play on Xbox, but FIREBALL is ran
          largely on PS5's. I have an adapter that will work for you! Questions
          here left unanswered? Join our Discord server by clicking on the
          button in the top-right! Take a look at our Organizers page to meet
          the faces that make sure FIREBALL runs smoothly every week, and take a
          look at the History page to view past results, brackets, and videos
          from FIREBALL.
