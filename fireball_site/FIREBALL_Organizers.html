              Nervous is the head tournament organizer for Fireball. After
              discovering Street Fighter in November of 2023, he broke away from
              the Smash community, and put together the FIREBALL tournament
              series. Loves Terry Bogard.

              He may be new to the FGC as a whole, but his fire for learning and
              improvement is something that all should aspire to. Brings a
              positive energy that can't be replaced. Best popoffs.

              BackroundVoice is one of the backbones of Fireball. Equipped with
              extensive knowledge of the FGC beyond the confines of Rexburg, and
              a well equipped setup, he offers a lot to the community.
              Professional hugger (grappler main).

              Why this dude is here competing with us is a mystery that few can
              solve. Placed 25th at Evolution 2023 in Guilty Gear: Strive. His
              3000+ hours of Guilty Gear allows a lot of newer players to learn
              a lot. That, alongside his experience TOing has allowed the
              Fireball Series to expand beyond anything that it could've
              otherwise. Will not approach.

              Venue expert. He allows us to set up in the lounge where he lives,
              and makes sure that we can all get in. Combined with his artistic
              talent (bringing us our image on the homepage), he brings things
              unreplacable to this small scene. Has fundamentals so good, that
              he has gotten into our top 5 Street Fighter players without even
              owning the game.

              What he may lack in first place finishes, he makes up for in
              passion and knowledge of frame data. Ask him anything about Guilty
              Gear, and he'll have an answer. Brings the mic so that our audio
              can be clear on stream. Needs a new controller.

              Few will be able to name a character more jovial than YummyBoii.
              Equiped with years of experience, a setup loaded with games that
              few have even heard of before, killer trash talk, good advice, and
              solid results to boot, YummyBoii is irreplacable in this
              community.

              This certified oldhead loves to bring the hands in Street Fighter.
              His fundamentals and game-sense carry him in our other events. He
              trives off of hitting the Iron Man infinite in Marvel vs Capcom 2,
              getting Perfect KO's, simple combo routes, and, above all else,
              spreading his knowledge to newer players.
