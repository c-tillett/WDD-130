        <h3 class="TO_Name">Nervous</h3>
        <p class="TO_Bio">
        Nervous is the head tournament organizer for Fireball. After discovering Street Fighter in November of 2023, he broke away from the Smash 
        community, and put together the FIREBALL tournament series. Loves Terry Bogard.
        </p>

        <h3 class="TO_Name">BackrouncVoice</h3>
        <p class="TO_Bio"> 
        BackroundVoice is one of the backbones of Fireball. Equipped with extensive knowledge of the FGC beyond the confines of Rexburg, and a well 
        equipped setup, he offers a lot to the community. Professional hugger (grappler).

        <p class="TO_Bio">
        Why this dude is here competing with us is a mystery that few can solve. Placed 25th at Evolution 2023 in Guilty Gear: Strive. 
        His 3000+ hours of Guilty Gear allows a lot of newer players to learn a lot. That, alongside his experience TOing has allowed the Fireball Series to expand beyond anything that it could've 
        otherwise. Will not approach.
        </p>

        <p class="TO_Bio">
        Venue expert. He allows us to set up in the lounge where he lives, and makes sure that we can all get in. Combined with his artistic talent 
        (bringing us our image on the homepage), he brings things unreplacable to this small scene. Has fundamentals so good, that he has gotten into 
        our top 5 Street Fighter players without even owning the game.
        </p>

        <p class="TO_Bio">
        He may be new to the FGC as a whole, but his fire for learning and improvement is something that all should aspire to. Brings a positive 
        energy that can't be replaced. Best popoffs.
        </p>

        <h3 class="TO_Name">Blazelighter</h3>
        <p class="TO_Bio">
        What he may lack in first place finishes, he makes up for in passion and knowledge of frame data. Ask him anything about Guilty Gear, 
        and he'll have an answer. Brings the mic so that our audio can be clear on stream. Needs a new controller.
        </p>

        <img src="" alt="YummyBoii" class="profile_pic">
        <h3 class="TO_Name">YummyBoii</h3>
        <p class="TO_Bio">
        Few will be able to name a character more jovial than YummyBoii. Equiped with years of experience, a setup loaded with games that few 
        have even heard of before, killer trash talk, good advice, and solid results to boot, YummyBoii is irreplacable in this community. 
        </p>

        <img src="" alt="Zortos" class="profile_pic">
        <h3 class="TO_Name">Zortos</h3>
        <p class="TO_Bio">
        This certified oldhead loves to bring the hands in Street Fighter. His fundamentals and game-sense carry him in our other events. He trives 
        off of hitting the Iron Man infinite in Marvel vs Capcom 2, getting Perfect KO's, simple combo routes, and, above all else, spreading his knowledge to newer players.
        </p>

        Because this guy decided to buy Street Fighter VI and teach Nervous some basics, FIREBALL has come to be. Time and time again, he proves that 
        he has the means to stand at the peak with other top players. His respect for others and insatiable appatiete for improvement keeps players better than him around, raising the overall quality of our scene.
