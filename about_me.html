    <h4>Nervous</h4>
    <p>
      I'm currently studying software engineering so that one day I
      can...engineer software!

      In between classes, planning my future wedding, and updating my YouTube, I
      run local Fighting Game tournaments every Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love Street Fighter 6 and Super Smash Brothers: Melee above other games
      I compete in.

      Right now, I work at the student support center on-campus. If you've ever
      sent in an email or chatted on the school website, you've probably
      interacted with me at some point.
